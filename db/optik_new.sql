They will be sending digital records between the two locations. Single records that will be transmitted can be as large as 16Gig but will useually be in the neighborhood of 1MB. Thus they will be needing more then 1500kbps. I have shared with them priceing on DS3 connection. They are not willing to go this high in monthy reoccuring cost yet so they are looking into T1 lines that are multilinked.\r\n\r\nThe hospital currently has 1 T1 line that is for a connection to the internet and they are paying aproximently $900 per month. Three Meadows also has a T1 and they are paying nearly the same. I am perposing that the Hospital gets 2 IVAD Circuts and sets up at least 2000kbps to the internet and then connect the Hospital and Three Meadows with a point-to-point connection.\r\n\r\nWe are concidering a wireless backhaul but the landscape does not allow for a direct connection. This requires a relay off a nearby communications tower.

I recommend setting up the AVG Admin.  We should send him an estimate for remotely setting up the Administration Console application on a system.  All we will need is the license key. I will make a new ticket for this.\n\nI also spoke with Max and recommended that he migrates his 6 clients into a terminal server.  He said that they are looking into a new software package that would mean getting a new server.  I recommend that he speaks with me before makeing any commitments so I can help him make sure he considers everything.  It may be most bennificial to make the new server be a terminal server or it may be best to have dual servers setup seperat or in a cluster. I will leave this piece as recorded information that can be closed.\n\nI checked the logs on the cop as an investigation of the virus issue.
